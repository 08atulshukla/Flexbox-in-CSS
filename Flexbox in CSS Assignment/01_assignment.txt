Ans-1  Grid:CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns,
       making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables,
       grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.
       To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: 
       grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows,
       and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.

       Flexbox: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). 
       It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: flex;

       Choosing betwee Flexbox And CSS Grid depends on your specific requirments.
       
      You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items along a single axis.for example,when creating 
      navigation bars,header/footer layouts ,or aligning elements within a container . Flexboxis great for reposnsive
      designs where items can vary in size.

      You might choose CSS Grid when you need to creat more complex, two- dimensional layoutwith rpws and 
      colomns.It's particularly useful when you have a grid-like structure,such as galleries,Forms with multiple fields,
      or any design that requires precise control over both rows and colomns.

      In some cass ,you may even combine both  Flexboxand CSS Grid within a single layoutto leverage the 
      strengths of each model for different parts of your webpage.
